🗨️ Real-Time One-to-One Anonymous Chat App

A simple real-time anonymous chat application built using **Socket.IO**, **Node.js**, **Express**, and **EJS**.  
This app allows users to connect anonymously in a one-to-one chat room. If a user is alone, they wait until another joins. Once connected, they can chat instantly and anonymously in real time.

🛠️ How It Works

A user visits the site and starts a chat.
If another user is already waiting, they get paired instantly.
If no one is available, the user waits until someone else joins.
Once paired, both users can exchange messages in real time.
The app keeps matching users in pairs — 3rd waits for 4th, and so on.
